**About this Repo**

This repo tracks the changes made to the main control code for the robot used for Cloud Robotics Hackathon 2013 team Telemetrons.

The robot started out life being used for the Eurobot UK 2012 competition, details here: http://chrisbarlow.wordpress.com/category/its-all-here/competition-entries/eurobot/eurobot-2012-treasure-island-team-r-me-r-t/

**How the code was**

In its Eurobot incarnation, the robot was programmed to follow a pre-defined path, using wheel encoders to measure distance travelled and using ultrasonic and infra-red sensors to stop if the opponent robot crossed its path.

**Changes for CRH 2013**
